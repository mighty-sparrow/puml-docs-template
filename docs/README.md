# Don't Forget

Regular documentation needs a home too.

If you're using Github, it's possible to add a little PlantUML awesomeness directly to your documentation too. Just add a little code block and ensure the syntax is `plantuml`.

```
 ```plantuml
  ' and then add your diagram code here.
  A -> B: Check it out
  B o-->> A: Looks awesome.

```

Renders something like this:

```plantuml
A -> B: Check it out
B o-->> A: Looks awesome.
```
