# Reference

Most of the icons contained in these subdirectories were pulled from other sources (mostly the [`plantuml-stdlib`](https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml-stdlib) repository).

This is likely not the best way to organize a repository to use such third-party references. It's the way I usually set things up when I start a new project (or start working with a new client). I only include the things I need when I need them since I don't want to upload the entire `plantuml-stdlib` to their source control (and I also don't want to add too many external web requests for third-party icons either).
